# Auth Modal (Sign-up / Login)

## User goal

Authenticate with minimal friction and resume the action they attempted.

## Key UI

- Fast sign-up/login (email or social)
- Clear benefits copy
- Return-to-action behavior after success

## Backend needs

- Registration and login endpoints
- Token auth (Sanctum)
- Consistent JSON errors for unauthenticated requests

## Acceptance

- Unauthenticated upload/export actions trigger auth
- After auth, user returns to the original flow
