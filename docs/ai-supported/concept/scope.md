# Scope (MVP vs Later)

## MVP (build first)

- Auth + user accounts
- Effects catalog (GLOBAL)
- Upload original video file (USER_PRIVATE)
- Create processing job (video record + status transitions)
- Result page (preview + watermark controls)
- Exports (watermarked and premium)
- Payments/purchases/subscriptions (minimal)
- Public gallery publishing (USER_SHARED surface) with a global projection strategy

## Explicit non-goals (for MVP)

- Teams/organizations (seed mentions out of scope for now)
- Complex admin/reporting dashboards
- Expensive analytics across large datasets in the main product flow

## Seed reference
