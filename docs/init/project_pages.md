# AI Video Effects Studio – Mobile‑First Page Designs

_The following outlines a_ _mobile-first, TikTok/Instagram-inspired UX for an AI Video Effects Studio web app. Each page is designed for high engagement, conversion, and retention, with always-visible CTAs, freemium watermarks as a growth loop, and responsive layouts. (All copy is provided in English.)_

## Landing Page (Home)

- **Hero Section:** The top of the landing page features a full-viewport **vertical video preview** showcasing a trending effect in action (e.g. a looping sample video with an AI effect applied). This grabs attention immediately on mobile devices[\[1\]](https://www.omniconvert.com/blog/hero-section-examples/#:~:text=match%20at%20L412%20Mobile,version%20of%20desktop%E2%80%94it%E2%80%99s%20a%20distinct). A bold headline conveys the value (e.g. _“Turn your videos into viral AI creations”_) and a prominent **CTA button** labeled **“Make Yours”** is overlaid centrally or just beneath the video. This primary CTA is sticky and always visible – on mobile, it could remain fixed at the bottom as users scroll, ensuring users can act at any moment[\[2\]](https://www.senuto.com/en/blog/ecommerce-ui-design/#:~:text=Studies%20show%20that%20adding%20simple%2C,the%20way%20to%20do%20so)[\[3\]](https://www.senuto.com/en/blog/ecommerce-ui-design/#:~:text=FOCL%E2%80%99s%20approach%20underscores%20the%20importance,visitors%20toward%20making%20a%20purchase). The CTA uses a contrasting color for visibility and is thumb-accessible on small screens[\[1\]](https://www.omniconvert.com/blog/hero-section-examples/#:~:text=match%20at%20L412%20Mobile,version%20of%20desktop%E2%80%94it%E2%80%99s%20a%20distinct).
- **Popular Effects Carousel:** Scrolling down, users see a **horizontally swipeable carousel** of the most popular AI effects. Each effect is represented by a **card** containing a short **autoplay looping preview** (vertical clip) of that effect and the effect’s name. On each card, a secondary CTA button **“Try This”** is visible. Tapping an effect card or its “Try This” CTA opens the **Effect Detail Page** for that effect. (On desktop, this carousel may appear as a horizontal scroll; on mobile, it can be a swipeable deck). The carousel design is inspired by modern template libraries (e.g. Pollo AI’s effect gallery where each template is shown with a preview and _Use_ button).
- **Call to Action & Sign-Up Prompt:** The goal is to drive visitors into trying an effect immediately. Any interaction that leads to uploading (such as tapping **“Make Yours”** or **“Try This”**) will **trigger an Auth Modal** if the user is not signed in (see **Auth Modal** details below). The user can browse the landing page and even watch effect previews anonymously, but **upload functionality is gated** behind sign-up. A subtle prompt (e.g. “Sign up to create your own video”) can appear near the CTA to set the expectation of the sign-up requirement.
- **Responsive Design:** On mobile, the layout uses vertical stacking and thumb-friendly controls[\[1\]](https://www.omniconvert.com/blog/hero-section-examples/#:~:text=match%20at%20L412%20Mobile,version%20of%20desktop%E2%80%94it%E2%80%99s%20a%20distinct). The hero video auto-plays muted and loops for an immersive feel without requiring interaction (ensuring fast load and no sound surprises). The sticky “Make Yours” CTA persists to minimize friction in conversion[\[2\]](https://www.senuto.com/en/blog/ecommerce-ui-design/#:~:text=Studies%20show%20that%20adding%20simple%2C,the%20way%20to%20do%20so). On desktop or larger screens, the vertical video is centered with surrounding whitespace or a blurred background preview, and the CTA is at the side or below, still highly visible.
- **Additional Content (Optional):** Further down, a brief features section or social proof (e.g. “Used by 1M+ creators”) can be included to build trust, but kept concise to maintain focus on the primary action. The page bottom may have usual info (pricing, FAQs) but the primary purpose is to get users into the creation flow with as few distractions as possible.

## Effect Detail Page

- **Effect Overview & Preview:** This page highlights a specific effect the user selected. At the top is a **vertical video player** or preview container showing an example of this effect in action (e.g. a default sample clip demonstrating the effect’s visuals). The preview auto-plays on loop. **Minimal controls** overlay the preview – for example, an **intensity slider** to adjust the effect strength, or a toggle for minor variations. Keep controls simple and few, to avoid overwhelming new users. The UI is clean, focusing attention on the content preview.
- **Effect Title & Description:** Below or overlaying the video, the effect’s name is shown (e.g. _“Neon Glow”_, _“Comic Book Filter”_), along with a one-line description to excite the user (e.g. “Turns your video into a comic panel!”). A small info icon could open a more detailed description if needed.
- **Primary CTA (“Upload Video”):** Prominently displayed below the preview is a large CTA button **“Upload Video”** (or **“Apply to Your Video”**). This prompts the user to select a video file to apply the effect. The CTA is styled in a sticky manner – on mobile it might dock at the bottom of the screen as the user scrolls the page, so it’s always one tap away[\[2\]](https://www.senuto.com/en/blog/ecommerce-ui-design/#:~:text=Studies%20show%20that%20adding%20simple%2C,the%20way%20to%20do%20so). If the user is not logged in, tapping this will trigger the **Auth Modal** (sign-up flow) before proceeding to upload.
- **Additional Examples:** Scrolling reveals an **“Examples”** section – a vertically scrollable list or mini-gallery of example videos created with this effect. These could be thumbnails or short loops from the **Public Gallery** that showcase how different videos look with the effect (community content or curated samples). This not only provides social proof and inspiration but also keeps users engaged (mimicking the endless discovery of TikTok). Tapping an example might expand it in a lightbox for viewing, but primarily it reassures the user of the effect’s cool results.
- **Recommended Effects:** At the bottom of this page, include a **“You Might Also Like”** carousel with a few other effect cards (thumbnail + name + _“Try This”_ CTA) to encourage exploration. This keeps users in the app by suggesting other trendy effects – swiping through these could lead to other Effect Detail pages, increasing retention by browsing.
- **Behavior & Gating:** The effect preview should load quickly (possibly a low-res GIF/MP4 for instant start). Any attempt to upload without auth will prompt sign-up. Once signed in, tapping “Upload Video” advances to the **Upload & Processing** step for this effect. The transition should be seamless – possibly as an in-page overlay or a separate page with a loading indicator.

## Upload & Processing Page

- **Upload Interface:** Users are taken to a dedicated page (or modal) to upload their video after choosing an effect. The design is **mobile-optimized for vertical video files.** It presents an upload widget or file picker with guidance text: e.g. _“Upload a vertical video to apply_ _\[Effect Name\].”_ There may be an outline of a phone screen as a placeholder, indicating the vertical frame. If the effect has any specific requirements (e.g. “face visible” or length limit), those instructions appear here in a concise manner.
- **Progress Indicator:** Once the user selects a video, the page shows a **progress bar or spinner** with a message that the video is being processed. Use a fun, engaging tone in the loading messages to match the creative vibe – e.g. _“Magic incoming…”, “Applying_ _Neon Glow_ _to your video…”, “Just a moment, creating awesomeness…”_. These messages could even cycle through a few witty lines to entertain users during the wait (leveraging a light-hearted, TikTok-style tone).
- **Visual Feedback:** A small thumbnail or icon of the video could be shown with a processing overlay (so the user remembers what they uploaded). If processing will take more than a few seconds, consider showing an **estimated time** or a pulsating animation to reassure the user that progress is happening.
- **Behavior:** This page should automatically redirect the user to the **Result Page** for the processed video when ready. A smooth transition (perhaps a brief “Your video is ready!” message then auto-navigation) helps maintain excitement. In case of a long wait, you might offer an email notification option, but for V0 assume most videos process quickly enough for the user to stay. Ensure the progress state is clear and that the user cannot accidentally navigate away; on mobile, perhaps disable the back swipe or show a warning if they try to cancel mid-process.
- **Playful Elements:** Since the target audience is TikTok/Instagram users, consider playful microinteractions – e.g. an animated icon (sparkles or stars) during processing to emphasize the “AI magic”. Keep the user psychologically engaged so they don’t drop off during this step (loading feedback is critical for retention here).

## Result Page (Processed Video)

- **Video Preview:** The result page showcases the **processed video** in a large vertical video player that takes up most of the screen (especially on mobile, it might fill the viewport width). The video auto-plays on loop with the applied effect visible. Users can tap to play/pause or replay as needed. The background of the page can be a dark theme or blurred version of the video for focus.
- **Watermark Display:** For free-tier users, a semi-transparent **watermark** (e.g. the app’s logo or name) is overlaid on the video, typically in a corner. This watermark is **present by default for freemium users** – it serves as a viral loop mechanism (when users share this video on social media, it advertises the product) and a monetization gate (users are prompted to upgrade to remove it). The watermark might animate subtly or remain static; it should be visible enough to promote brand awareness without ruining the video content.
- **Controls – Watermark & Edits:** Below or beside the video, provide controls for **watermark adjustments** and basic editing:
- A **watermark opacity slider** or toggle allows the user to adjust transparency _within limits_. (For instance, they can make it slightly less opaque but not remove it entirely on free plan. A fully transparent option could be marked with a Pro badge).
- **Position options** for the watermark (e.g. drag to reposition corners) – free users can move it but it always shows; Pro users might get an option to remove it completely.
- Possibly a **“Pro Frames”** or filters option if applicable (e.g. premium decorative frames or additional effect enhancements) – tapping these could prompt an upgrade if they are only for paid users.
- Keep the UI minimal: for V0, focus on watermark controls as the key differentiator. These controls should have small lock icons or tooltips indicating which are Pro features if any.
- **Primary CTA – Download/Share:** The most prominent action here is enabling the user to **export their video**. Provide a **“Download”** button (for mobile, this might say “Save to device”). Tapping download:
- If the user is free and the watermark is present, it saves the video with watermark. You may remind them with a tooltip like “Downloaded video will include watermark. Upgrade to remove.”
- If the user has upgraded (or if they choose to upgrade now), they can download a clean version. In fact, a **secondary CTA “Remove Watermark (Go Pro)”** can be shown right next to Download, highlighting the upsell. For example: _“Upgrade to remove watermark and download high-quality video”_. This upsell CTA should stand out but not hinder the free use. _(This freemium approach is proven effective: offering full functionality with a watermark, then prompting removal as a paid feature encourages conversion_[_\[4\]_](https://userpilot.medium.com/how-to-build-an-effective-free-to-paid-conversion-strategy-3261c07456d5#:~:text=Offer%20these%20features%20in%20your,watermark%20to%20convert%20trial%20users)_.)_
- **Secondary Actions:** Alongside Download, include a **“Share / Publish”** option. This could be a button or icon that opens a small menu:
- **Share to Social**: Quick links or an OS share sheet to post the video to TikTok, Instagram, etc. (When sharing, the watermark ensures viewers on those platforms see the brand – a built-in viral referral loop).
- **Publish to Gallery**: An option labeled **“Publish Publicly”** or **“Publish to Gallery”** which will trigger the **Publish Modal** (detailed below). This invites the user to share their creation on the app’s public gallery for others to discover. If the user’s video does not have a watermark (e.g. a Pro user who removed it), they would be informed that publishing will add the watermark or that only watermarked videos are eligible (to preserve the viral branding in public content).
- **Personal Gallery Preview:** Below the video player and main CTAs, the user sees a mini **“Your Videos”** section. This is a horizontal scroll or grid of the user’s other processed videos (thumbnails of recent creations, if any). Each thumbnail might show a small watermark icon or label if that video is watermarked, and an icon if it’s published. The first item could be a ghosted card prompting “+ Create New Video” to encourage further use. This gallery preview keeps users engaged by reminding them of their content library and inviting them to continue creating or managing past videos (boosting retention by building a habit of multiple creations).
- **Video Details and Options:** If the user taps one of their other video thumbnails, it should navigate to that video’s result page or editing view. Each video card could have a **menu (⋯)** for quick actions: **Edit/Reapply Effect** (reopens the effect detail with that video pre-loaded if re-editing is allowed), **Download** (again), **Share**, or **Delete**. For V0, a simple tap can just open that result page.
- **Upgrade Prompts:** If the user is free, subtle prompts to upgrade can be woven in: e.g. a banner under the video “⭐ Remove watermark and keep videos longer with Pro”. We also display any **expiry timer** for free videos here: if free videos expire after, say, 24 hours or 7 days, show a small notice like _“Expires in 6 days – upgrade to keep it permanently.”_ This creates urgency and an incentive to either share now (viral effect) or upgrade to save.
- **Retention Considerations:** The result page is a key point in the loop. By immediately showing share/download options and the user’s gallery, it encourages the user to either share (bringing in new users via watermark) or continue engaging with more effects. The design ensures that even after one video is done, the journey continues (create more, share more).

## Auth Modal (Sign-Up/Login)

- **When it Appears:** This modal is **triggered whenever a user tries a gated action** without being signed in. For instance: clicking “Make Yours” on the landing, “Try This” on an effect, “Upload Video” on effect page, or any download/share if we choose to gate those as well. The goal is to make sign-up **lightweight and fast**, especially on mobile.
- **Design & Layout:** On mobile, the Auth prompt likely appears as a full-screen overlay or slide-up sheet. It should have a clear title like _“Join to Create Your Video”_ or _“Sign Up to Continue”_. The benefits of signing up can be listed in a line or two (e.g. _“Save your videos, share with friends, and explore new effects.”_). Keep the design simple with minimal required input to reduce friction.
- **Sign-Up Options:** Provide **one-tap social logins** prominently: buttons for **Continue with TikTok** (if available via web), **Continue with Google**, **Apple**, etc., since the target users likely have social accounts. These should be large, branded buttons for easy tapping. Alternatively (or additionally), allow sign-up with email: an email address field and a “Send Magic Link” or “Continue” button (to do passwordless email login), or an email + password quick form. The emphasis is on speed: ideally, social login will dominate for a near-instant account creation.
- **Login for Existing Users:** A small toggle or link can let an existing user switch to **“Log In”** if they already have an account (email/password login form or social login again). This should be accessible but not as prominent as the sign-up flows.
- **UX Considerations:** The modal should be **modal in behavior** – i.e., the user cannot continue the action without completing sign-up or closing the modal. If they close it, they return to browsing but the upload/action won’t proceed. On successful sign-up/login, the modal disappears and the user is **routed back to the action they initiated** (e.g., if they hit “Upload Video” originally, then after signing in, the upload dialog reappears or continues to the processing page).
- **Mobile-Friendly Flow:** Ensure the form fits on smaller screens without scrolling (use a vertical stack of buttons/fields). Use clear wording: e.g. “Sign up in seconds to create your video.” Also, reassure privacy lightly (maybe a link to terms below the buttons). _By keeping the sign-up process short and integrated at the point of need, we remove friction and keep users engaged_[\[5\]](https://userpilot.medium.com/how-to-build-an-effective-free-to-paid-conversion-strategy-3261c07456d5#:~:text=,the%20trial%20experience%20more%20enjoyable).
- **Visual Style:** The modal background can be a blurred version of whatever was behind (so the user still sees the cool video they were about to create, motivating them). The design should feel like a natural extension of the app’s style (same colors, fonts). It’s not a separate page, but rather a quick step.

## User Gallery Page (My Videos)

- **Page Overview:** This is the **user’s personal gallery** of all videos they have processed through the app. It’s accessible via a “My Videos” or profile icon. The layout is a **scrollable grid of vertical video thumbnails**, optimized for mobile viewing. Each video is represented by its cover frame or a short looping thumbnail, with overlays indicating its status.
- **Gallery Layout:** On mobile, use a two-column grid of rectangular thumbnails (approx. 9:16 aspect). Each thumbnail should be tall enough to see the content clearly but small enough to show at least a few on the screen at once. On desktop, this can expand to more columns. The top of the page can have a header saying “Your Videos” and perhaps a filter or sort dropdown (e.g. sort by latest, or filter by effect if needed).
- **Video Card Details:** Each video card includes:
- **Thumbnail/preview:** Either a static frame or an autoplay mini-video (autoplay on scroll into view, muted).
- **Video title or effect name:** A small label either overlaid at the top or bottom of the thumbnail. If users can input titles, show that; otherwise, show the effect name used (e.g. “Neon Glow”).
- **Watermark status:** An icon or text if the video is currently watermarked (for free users). For example, a small watermark icon 🌐 or the word “Watermarked” in corner. If a video is watermark-free (Pro video), it might show a “Pro” tag or simply no watermark icon.
- **Expiry Timer (for free users):** If free videos expire after some time, display a subtle countdown or expiry info on the thumbnail. For instance, a small clock icon and “24h left” if the video will be deleted soon for free users. This creates urgency to upgrade or download. If the user upgrades, these timers would disappear on their videos.
- **Menu Actions:** A tappable “...” on each card (or a swipe action) to reveal actions: **Download**, **Share**, **Re-effect/Edit**, **Delete**. On mobile, tapping a video could also directly open its Result Page, where these actions exist, so a long-press or small icon might be needed for quick actions.
- **Behavior:** Tapping a video thumbnail opens the **Result Page** for that video (showing it in full, with the same controls for watermark and download). This allows users to revisit their creation, adjust watermark or share it later. If a video has expired (or is about to), tapping it might prompt “This video expired, re-process or upgrade to restore” (depending on how strict the expiry is implemented).
- **New Creation:** At the top of the gallery or as the first grid item, have a **“New Video”** card (with a “+” icon and label like “Create New”). This is a shortcut to go back to the effect selection flow (maybe it scrolls back to the landing page effects carousel or opens an effect gallery chooser). This consistently invites the user to make something new, improving retention by always providing a next action.
- **Gallery Navigation & Info:** If the user has no videos yet (empty state), show a friendly message like _“No videos yet. Try an effect to get started!”_ and a CTA to go to the effects list. For users with many videos, implement infinite scroll or pagination as they scroll down, loading older videos.
- **Mobile Optimization:** The page uses lazy-loading for video thumbnails to keep performance smooth. The design avoids heavy text – primarily visuals – to feel like a personal “library” akin to a camera roll or TikTok profile page. Key statuses (watermark, expiry) use icons or short text to avoid clutter.
- **Encouraging Upgrade & Engagement:** If a lot of the user’s videos are watermarked or expiring, a banner at top could say _“Upgrade to Pro to remove all watermarks and keep your videos forever.”_ Also, encourage sharing: maybe each card has a small share icon overlay so the user can share a video directly from the gallery (which helps the viral loop). The more they share, the more likely they’ll bring new users and also see value in the product themselves.

## Public Gallery Page (Explore)

- **Page Purpose:** The **Explore/Public Gallery** page is where users (even unregistered) can browse **publicly shared videos** created by others. This page showcases the app’s output and inspires new users to try those effects on their own videos. The design should be engaging and scrollable, much like a TikTok or Reels feed, but also provide a clear path to use the same effect.
- **Layout – Grid or Feed:** For V0, a **grid of video cards** is effective for discovery. On mobile, a two-column grid of vertical video thumbnails works (similar to Instagram’s Explore grid). Each card is a vertical video thumbnail or short looping clip. Optionally, a single-column **swipeable feed** (where each video plays one after another) can be considered for future, but initially a tappable grid is simpler.
- **Video Card Info:** Each public video card should include:
- The **video preview** (with the applied effect visible). These could autoplay silently as they come into view to grab attention.
- An overlay text or badge naming the **Effect used** on that video (e.g. “Neon Glow”). This text might sit at the top or bottom of the thumbnail, with a slight shadow background for readability.
- A **CTA button or icon** on the card: **“Use This Effect”**. For example, a small banner on the bottom of the thumbnail saying “🔥 Try **Neon Glow**”. Alternatively, an on-hover or tap overlay that appears with the effect name and a “Use This” button. On mobile, a small persistent “Use” button on each card is useful since hover isn’t available – perhaps a play icon on the thumbnail that doubles as a CTA icon. The wording should entice action, e.g. “Use This Effect” clearly indicates the user can apply the same style to their own video.
- **Navigation/Interaction:** When a user taps a video or the “Use This Effect” CTA:
- They could be taken directly to the **Effect Detail Page** for that effect, _pre-selected_ with that effect. (We might also auto-play the chosen example video there as the preview, or list it in the examples section.)
- Alternatively, tapping the video could play it in a larger view or lightbox for the user to watch fully, with a prominent “Use This Effect” button alongside the playback. However, to streamline, it may be better to jump straight to the effect page where they can then upload their own video.
- **Content Volume & Filtering:** The gallery can be endless-scrolling. At the top, consider adding simple filters or categories (e.g. by effect category, or a search bar to find effects). The user could filter “Trending”, “Newest”, or by tags. For V0, a default sort by trending popularity is fine. We want new visitors to see impressive results upfront.
- **Anonymous Access:** This page should be viewable without login to entice new users (a lurker can explore and then be prompted to sign up when they want to try something). It serves as both inspiration and social proof. Upload actions from here will trigger auth as usual (e.g. clicking “Use This Effect” will require sign-up if not logged in, then proceed to that effect’s upload).
- **Viral Loop Emphasis:** All videos here carry the app’s watermark (since only watermarked videos can be published publicly). The watermark on each video ensures that when these are watched (even outside the site, if someone shares a direct link), the brand is advertised. Each card might also show the creator’s username or avatar (optional for V0), which could encourage community feel. However, initial focus is on effect and CTA rather than the person.
- **Performance & UX:** Use pagination or lazy load as the user scrolls to load more videos. Tapping back from an effect page should return them to the gallery scroll position (for a seamless browse-try-back pattern). Visually, keep the page clean: dark or light background depending on theme, with videos as the colorful elements. It should feel like an **exploration hub** of fun content where every piece invites “I want to try this too!”

## Publish Modal (Share to Public Gallery)

- **When it Appears:** After a user has processed a video (on the **Result Page** or later from their Gallery), if they choose **“Publish”** or **“Share to Public”**, this modal is launched. It allows the user to add details and confirm making their video public in the gallery.
- **Content & Fields:** The Publish Modal is a simple form overlay. It includes:
- **Video Preview:** A small thumbnail or mini-player of the video they’re about to publish (to remind them which one it is).
- **Title Field:** An input box for the video title or caption. Pre-fill it if possible (maybe the effect name or a generic title), but allow the user to edit. For example, _“My Neon Glow creation”_ could be a default that the user can change.
- **Tags Field:** A field to add tags or choose categories. This can be a tokenized input where they type and create simple tags (e.g. “art, neon, glow”) or a list of checkboxes for existing categories (if we have predefined ones like “Funny”, “Artistic”, “Before/After”, etc.). Tags help other users filter content in the public gallery (though for V0, tags can be optional).
- Possibly an option to toggle **“Public Visibility”** on/off (but since they invoked publish, it’s likely on by default). If we want to allow them to un-publish later, we might mention they can remove it from public gallery in their “My Videos” later.
- A note that _“Your video will be shared publicly with all users.”_ and perhaps _“Videos must display the app watermark when public.”_ This note reinforces that the watermark will remain. If the user is Pro and had removed the watermark, we either **re-add the watermark for the gallery version** or warn them it will be added. For example: _“(✓) A watermark will be added to public videos to credit the effect studio.”_ – possibly as a small checkbox that’s checked and not removable, just to inform.
- **Sharing Options:** Optionally, the modal can have a checkbox like _“Also share to my profile”_ (which might be redundant, since it’s their profile anyway), or _“Allow this video to be featured”_ etc. But to keep it simple: Title, Tags, confirmation.
- **Confirmation CTA:** A big **“Publish”** button to confirm. It might say **“Publish Now”** or **“Share”**. When tapped:
- The video is marked as public and added to the Public Gallery feed.
- The user might get a success message like _“✅ Your video is now public! Check it out in Explore.”_ You could then offer a direct link: e.g. _“View it in the Public Gallery”_ or just close the modal.
- Encourage social sharing: maybe immediately after publishing, prompt _“Share your public video link with friends!”_ with share icons, since now it’s accessible via a public link.
- **UX Considerations:** If the user’s video does not meet public criteria (e.g., no watermark), the Publish button could be disabled until they acknowledge adding a watermark. Alternatively, if they somehow got here with a watermark removed, we simply add it back for the published version. The UI should clarify this to avoid surprise (“Your Pro video will show a small watermark in the public gallery”).
- **Design:** The modal should follow the same style as the Auth modal for consistency: centered on desktop, full-sheet on mobile. It should be quick to fill. Use placeholders like “Add a catchy title…” to guide the user. Tags input can be a simple comma-separated text for now to avoid complicated UI.
- **Community Guidelines:** Since this involves public sharing, a short reminder like _“Please ensure your video abides by our content guidelines.”_ with a link could be included at the bottom of the modal. This is a light touch to keep things safe (important if effects could be misused).
- **After Publishing:** Once published, the video’s card in the user’s gallery could get a “Public” label or icon (so they remember it’s shared). If they edit or remove from public, that state should update. For V0, removal can be just by deleting the video or a toggle in the gallery item actions.

Each page and component described above is focused on **maximizing engagement** (through easy browsing of effects and examples), **conversion** (via prominent CTAs and upgrade prompts), and **retention** (by encouraging creation, saving content, and sharing). The design takes heavy inspiration from TikTok’s vertical video experiences and modern design practices: always-visible action buttons (to catch the “impulse” moment[\[2\]](https://www.senuto.com/en/blog/ecommerce-ui-design/#:~:text=Studies%20show%20that%20adding%20simple%2C,the%20way%20to%20do%20so)), mobile-first layouts[\[1\]](https://www.omniconvert.com/blog/hero-section-examples/#:~:text=match%20at%20L412%20Mobile,version%20of%20desktop%E2%80%94it%E2%80%99s%20a%20distinct), and freemium feature gating like watermarks which drive virality and upsells[\[4\]](https://userpilot.medium.com/how-to-build-an-effective-free-to-paid-conversion-strategy-3261c07456d5#:~:text=Offer%20these%20features%20in%20your,watermark%20to%20convert%20trial%20users). All pages are responsive, but optimized for small screens first, ensuring fast, fun interaction for users coming from Instagram or TikTok ads. The above specification is ready for implementation in a V0 product or design system, providing a clear blueprint for a high-retention, TikTok-native UX for the AI Video Effects Studio.
